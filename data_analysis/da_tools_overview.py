# Today, we will discuss a high level overview of several data analysis tools.
# Each of these tools will be used in our upcoming Data Analysis Series.
# 
# Anaconda
# IPython
# numpy
# pandas

# and if we have time... we'll solve a puzzle from one of my 
# favorite puzzle sites: 
#     checkio.org

# Let's start with Anaconda
# From Continuum Analytic's webpage:

#     "Anaconda is a completely free Python distribution (including for commercial
#      use and redistribution). It includes more than 300 of the most popular Python
#      packages for science, math, engineering, and data analysis."

# Anaconda solves some tricky problems:
#     * resolves interdependencies between multiple libraries
#     * installs as a single bundle or you can pick and choose libraries
#     * takes a lot of the headache out of setting up a computing environment
